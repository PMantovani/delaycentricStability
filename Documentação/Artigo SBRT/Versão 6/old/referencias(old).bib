  Abstract                 = {While it is more and more usual to buy computer equipment with multiple network interfaces, and the proliferation of ISPs for both wired and wireless users provides different solutions to access the network core, upper layers across the protocol spectrum seem unprepared to accept the challenge posed by multiple interfaces and, consequently, by multiple paths between the same source-destination pair. This paper tries to partially answer this challenge by proposing an enhancement of the SCTP protocol that aims at balancing load across multiple connections on disjoint paths in an accurate fashion, through the knowledge of bandwidth estimation on each path. Some results confirm the viability of the approach and invite further research.},

  Abstract                 = {The seamless handover of streamed video in a WLAN with UDP as the transport layer is considered. The use of handover for stationary nodes in the case of network congestion is motivated. Next, the relationship between delay and loss in WLANs is studied, with the conclusion that delay can be used as an indicator of when loss is likely to occur. Delay can therefore be used as a basis of a handover scheme which can minimize loss. Such a handover scheme is proposed in which the client makes two simultaneous connections to the same server through two separate WLANs, and it is shown that the client can use the relative packet delay between the two streams to determine which network delivers the best performance; this information is then used to determine when to perform a handover. The proposed scheme is implemented and results are presented that show the successful handover of an RTP over UDP stream using this scheme in a live WLAN environment.},

  Abstract                 = {In parallel with the growth of VoIP services, a large number of manufacturers have begun to develop multimode devices capable of connecting to multiple wireless access networks simultaneously. These multimode terminals have, in principle, the capability to support seamless handover between different radio access networks. One handover solution that utilises the IP diversity which these multimode devices can deliver is SIGMA. SIGMA is a promising end-to-end transport layer handover solution based on SCTP. The objective of this paper is to investigate if SIGMA is capable of providing seamless handover of VoIP calls without degradation in voice quality. To achieve this, we developed a Linux based testbed on which we implemented a VoIP client and server using SIGMA handoff. Each voice call uses the G.711 voice codec over RTP. PR-SCTP is used in place of the traditional UDP as the transport layer protocol. SIGMA based handover was used during full duplex voice calls between the client and server. The ITU-T E-Model has been used to calculate the voice quality during the handover. Results show that SIGMA can be used as a seamless handover mechanism for VoIP without any impact on voice quality.},

The multihoming capability and dynamic address configuration extension of SCTP are applied in an UMTS/WLAN overlay architecture to decrease handover delay and improve throughput performance. Unlike techniques based on Mobile IT or Session Initiation Protocol, the SCTP-based vertical handover scheme does not require the addition of components such as home/foreign agents or a SIP server to existing networks. Therefore, the proposed scheme provides a network-independent solution preferred by service providers. Performance evaluations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},
